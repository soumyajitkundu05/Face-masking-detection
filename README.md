# Face-masking-detection


This project focuses on developing a real-time face mask detection system
using deep learning techniques. The system utilizes a pre-trained
CNN model for face detection and a custom-trained mask detector
model.
This face mask detection system can be used in various settings, such as public
spaces, offices, or schools, to ensure compliance with face mask policies. The
real-time nature of the system enables quick identification of individuals not
wearing masks, allowing for prompt action to maintain public health and
safety.
